# TSI-4040-4140-Volume-meter
This is my first applictation using Qt. This app works with both TSI 4040 and 4140 on Windows, but you could compile it for Mac or Linux using source filies. 

COM Port 6 is used by default, though you can choose whatever port you like. App is used to measure summ of air volume which is gone through the device. It could also measure "breathing" cycles, though there is some issued are needed to be solved.

You are free to use this program in any way you'd like to.
Enjoy!
